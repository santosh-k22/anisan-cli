AniSan is a modular, performant CLI for **browsing, streaming, and tracking anime**. It provides a flexible Lua-based scraping system and a fast TUI experience.

## 🎯 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔌 **Lua-Powered Scrapers** | Easily extensible sources (AllAnime ships by default). |
| 🖼️ **Terminal Img Renderer**| High-fidelity Anime Cover Art rendered dynamically during TUI search/history via TrueColor ANSI blocking. |
| 🎬 **MPV Integration** | Background IPC control, auto-resume, visual chapter markers, and HTTP header support. |
| 📡 **Tracking Sync** | Two-way sync with **Anilist** and **MyAnimeList** featuring an internal offline persistence queue for both backends. |
| 📊 **Rich History Model** | Visually tracks watch progress, statuses, aggregated scores, and associated genres locally. |
| ⚡ **7-Day Caching** | Instantaneous TUI loading powered by a native Go metadata cache. |
| ⏩ **Auto-Skip Intro** | Integration with [AniSkip](https://api.aniskip.com) to skip OP/ED. |
| 🛡️ **Bypass** | HTTP/2 + uTLS fingerprinting to bypass Cloudflare. |
| 🎨 **TUI** | Beautiful "Catppuccin" themed UI with fluid wrap-around navigation. |
| 🍏 **IINA Support** | Native macOS player integration with full feature parity. |

## 📦 Installation

### From Source (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santosh-k22/anisan-cli.git
cd anisan-cli
go install .
```

### Dependencies

- **Go** 1.25+ (to build)
- **mpv** (required for playback)
    - macOS: `brew install mpv` (or use **IINA**)
    - Linux: `sudo apt install mpv`
    - Windows: `scoop install mpv`

### Using IINA (macOS only)
To use IINA instead of MPV on macOS, update your configuration:
```bash
anisan config set -k player -v iina
```

## ⚡ Usage

### Interactive Mode (TUI)
Simply run the command to enter the interactive interface:
```bash
anisan
```

### Quick CLI Mode (Inline or Headless)
Search, stream, or sync progress without entering the TUI:

```bash
# Search and select
anisan inline -q "Attack on Titan"

# Auto-select first result and play first episode
anisan inline -q "Bleach" --source allanime --anime first --episode first

# Continue watching from history
anisan inline --continue

# Mark an episode as watched headlessly (syncs to configured tracker)
anisan mark -q "Jujutsu Kaisen" -e 12
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

AniSan is incredibly customizable. You can control the app through the CLI configuration command, or by directly editing the active config file.

### Command-Line Configuration
You can read or overwrite ANY built-in config directly from your shell by passing key-value pairs.
```bash
# Get a value
anisan config get player.aniskip

# Set a value
anisan config set -k player.aniskip -v false

# Change Tracker Backend (anilist or mal)
anisan config set -k tracker.backend -v mal

# Reset a value to default
anisan config reset -k player.aniskip
```
*Tip: Run `anisan config get` without any keys to view your entire active configuration tree.*

## 🔗 Syncing with MyAnimeList & AniList
AniSan natively supports background episode synchronization to both MyAnimeList and AniList.
You can configure your preferred primary tracker using the `tracker.backend` configuration key (defaults to `anilist`).

To authenticate the trackers, use the built-in oauth agents:
```bash
# Authorize AniList
anisan anilist auth

# Authorize MyAnimeList
anisan mal auth
```
*Note: The interactive TUI will proactively check your authentication status before playback, preventing any silent sync failures in the background.*

### Key Configuration Options

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `player.aniskip` | `true` | Enable/Disable auto-skipping intros via AniSkip. |
| `anilist.enable` | `false` | Enable Anilist integration. |
| `anilist.link_on_anime_select` | `true` | Prompt to link to Anilist when selecting an anime. |
| `tui.show_urls` | `true` | Show URLs in the list view. |
| `logs.level` | `info` | Log level (panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace). |
| `icons.variant` | `plain` | Icon set (emoji, nerd, plain, kaomoji). |

*(See `anisan config info` for a full list of options)*

### The `anisan.toml` Config File
For power users, AniSan naturally stores all configurations in a unified `toml` file. Changes made here apply instantaneously to the CLI.

**Location**:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.config/anisan/anisan.toml` (or `~/Library/Application Support/anisan/anisan.toml`)
*(You can override this by exporting `ANISAN_CONFIG_PATH=/custom/path` in your `.zshrc`)*

**Example `anisan.toml`**:
```toml
[player]
default = "mpv"  # Options: mpv, iina
aniskip = true   # Auto-skip anime intros/outros
completion_percentage = 80  # Mark watched at 80%

[tui]
item_spacing = 1
read_on_enter = true
show_urls = true
reverse_episodes = false
```

### Automatic Intro Skipping (AniSkip)
AniSan natively integrates with **AniSkip** via an internal Go implementation—no external Python or Lua scripts required.

When you play an episode, AniSan silently queries `api.aniskip.com` for the exact timestamps of the Opening (OP) and Ending (ED). It then monitors a hidden Unix socket and dispatches lightning-fast `seek` commands to `mpv` to seamlessly bypass them.

*(Note: AniSkip currently requires `mpv`. Native players like `iina` operate independently of the socket).*

```bash
# To disable AniSkip:
anisan config set player.aniskip false
```

## 📡 Integrations

### MyAnimeList (MAL)
Authenticate to sync your watch progress automatically.

1. **Authenticate**:
   ```bash
   anisan mal auth
   ```
   This will open your browser. Login and approve the app.

2. **Usage**:
   - In the episode list, press `m` to search and link the anime to a MAL entry.
   - Once linked, progress will sync automatically when you reach ~80% of an episode.

### Anilist
1. **Authenticate**:
   ```bash
   anisan anilist auth
   ```
   This will open your browser, request access for AniSan, and safely store the token.
2. **Usage**:
   - In the episode list, press `a` to search and link the anime to an Anilist entry manually.

### Progress Syncing & Manual Overrides
AniSan syncs your watch history directly to MyAnimeList (MAL) or Anilist automatically once you surpass the `completion_percentage` (default 80%).

Sometimes, a scraped Anime title doesn't perfectly match the MAL/Anilist database (e.g., alternate English names). If auto-sync fails to recognize the show:
1. Open the Anime's **Episodes Menu**.
2. Press **`I`** to open the **Manual ID Override** modal.
3. Type in the official MAL or Anilist ID for the show.
4. Hit Enter to instantly fetch and permanently cache the official metadata. All future episodes will sync perfectly.

## ⌨️ Keybindings & TUI Navigation

AniSan's TUI is designed for speed. **Wrap-Around Scrolling** is enabled globally—pressing `Up` on the first item jumps to the bottom, and vice versa.

**Global Navigation**
- `↑` / `k`: Up (Wraps around)
- `↓` / `j`: Down (Wraps around)
- `←` / `h`: Previous page
- `→` / `l`: Next page
- `/` : Activate fuzzy filtering (filters titles, genres, and media statuses)
- `g`: Jump to Top
- `G`: Jump to Bottom
- `q`: Quit
- `esc`: Back / Cancel
- `?`: Toggle help menu

**Episode List Actions**
- `enter`: Play selected episode
- `m`: Search/Link MyAnimeList dynamically
- `a`: Search/Link Anilist dynamically
- `I`: **Manual ID Override** (Input MAL/Anilist ID directly)
- `v`: Select all episodes strictly by Volume
- `o`: Open episode source URL in browser

**Post-Watch Menu**
*(Appears automatically when an episode finishes or the player is closed)*
- **Next**: Instantly play the next chronological episode
- **Replay**: Restart the current episode
- **Previous**: Play the prior chronological episode
- **Quit**: Return to the main menu
